Project Overview:
Create a members-only website where users can access the life stories of Robin Noor. Users sign up or sign in from the homepage and immediately taken to their dashboard. They will see different story cards, and each card takes the user to a multimedia page where they can watch, listen or read a life story about Robin.

Requirements:
- Find a way to have users sign up and sign in.(I have an existing Supabase account if we need to use it.)
- Find a way for story cards to open a new story page where the story is housed.
- Find a way for users to add a comment on story pages.
- Find a way for users to submit their own stories of Robin.

For visuals, see the designs in the "design_files" folder. That is the UI I want to achieve. 

All databases for form entries, story cards, comment threads and user information can be found here: https://notion-dgmd-cc.vercel.app/group/1864ffe6f70c802e8cf2ebaf8a76d825/1864ffe6f70c817fb043eb01a3b84039
